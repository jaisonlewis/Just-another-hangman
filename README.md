# Just-another-hangman
Second project: Hangman
It's a gob standard hangman game. The text file can be changed, words on that were generated from chatGPT. I wanted a specific list of words with 5-7 letters so it doesn't get tedious play. Reused some of the randomise and word pickup code from the Madlibs project.
